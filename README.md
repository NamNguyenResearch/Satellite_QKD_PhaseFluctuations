Abstract: Satellite FSO/QKD systems employ free-space optical links between satellites and ground stations to achieve long-distance quantum key distribution. However, these systems face challenges from atmospheric turbulence. This paper introduces a theoretical framework to evaluate the influence of phase fluctuations caused by atmospheric turbulence on the system performance. Mathematical expressions for key performance metrics are derived and validated through Monte-Carlo simulations. Using results from the framework, we provide a recommended system setup to fulfil the QKD performance requirements under different atmospheric turbulence conditions.
